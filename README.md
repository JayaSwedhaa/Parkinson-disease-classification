# Parkinson-disease-classification
Parkinson disease is a brain disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements. This project is focused to build a model that detects the presence of Parkinson disease in the given data with help of assigned feature. XGBoost is a ML Algorithm known for its speed and well performance. Hence, I have used XGBClassifierfier  in this project.
